---------------------- Step 1: Setting up the Game Framework ---------------------- 

1.1. Initialize the data structure for character stats.
1.2. Generate random values for player's strength and health.
1.3. Generate random values for the 3 monsters' strength and health.
1.4. Create the game loop structure.
1.5. Implement a basic user interface to display character stats.
1.6. Prompt the player for actions (attack or heal).



---------------------- Step 2: Implementing Actions ---------------------- 

2.1. Implement the player's attack action.
2.2. Handle player's healing action.
2.3. Implement random monster attacks.
2.4. Update character stats after each action.



---------------------- Step 3: Win/Lose Conditions ---------------------- 

3.1. Check for the player's health falling to zero.
3.2. Check for all monsters being defeated.
3.3. End the game if a win or lose condition is met.



---------------------- Step 4: Subroutines ---------------------- 

4.1. Create a subroutine for calculating character stats.
4.2. Create a subroutine for random number generation.
4.3. Define subroutines for attack and heal actions.
4.4. Implement a subroutine for the game loop.



---------------------- Step 5: Debugging and Testing ---------------------- 

5.1. Debug and test the initialization of character stats.
5.2. Debug and test the player's actions.

5.3. Debug and test the win/lose conditions.

5.4. Debug and test the subroutines.

5.5. Verify the overall game functionality.



---------------------- Step 6: Optimization ---------------------- 

6.1. Review the code for potential performance improvements.

6.2. Optimize memory usage where possible.

6.3. Ensure the game runs efficiently.



---------------------- Step 7: Additional Features ---------------------- 

7.1. Implement any additional features or enhancements.

7.2. Test and debug the new features.
